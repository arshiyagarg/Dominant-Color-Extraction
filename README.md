<h1> Dominant Color Extraction </h1>
<p>Our Dominant Color Extraction project utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze images and identify their most prominent colors. This tool is crucial for applications in digital design,
  branding, and data visualization, where color accuracy and appeal are essential. Its scalable architecture enables
  it to process large volumes of images efficiently, making it ideal for use in extensive projects such as e-commerce platforms, where consistent and attractive color palettes enhance user experience and
  engagement. </p>
